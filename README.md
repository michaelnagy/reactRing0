This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It will be used as a homepage for the [Ring-0](https://ringsec.net/(https://ringsec.net) Website.

To use the GithubRepo Component you will need to create a config.js in the root folder with your login credentials:

```javascript
const github = {
  username: 'yourusername',
  pass: 'yourpass'
}

export { github };
```

All commands to start this project can be found on Create React App repository.
